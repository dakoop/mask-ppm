# mask-ppm:

Open Terminal.app on Mac OS and switch to the directory where the script is located.

Then, enter the following command
```bash 
bash mask.sh image.ppm mask.pbm > output.ppm
```

The above command uses `mask.sh` to apply `mask.pbm` over the image `image.ppm` and output to `output.ppm`.
