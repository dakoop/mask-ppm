# mask-ppm

To solve the first question of the assignment, I forked the 'mask-ppm' repository. In order to clone the mask-ppm repository to my computer, I copied the repository url under my account and ran it with 'git clone' command on Terminal. This copied the content of 'mask-ppm' to my desktop. 

Now the command 'bash mask.sh image.ppm mask.pbm > output.ppm' was run in Terminal.

The given command basically runs the script in the file 'mask.sh'. this masks 'mask.pbm' to the image file 'image.ppm' and transforms it to 'output.ppm'.

All these images can be seen in the .png format at Netpbm Viewer browser.


NOTE: After completing the question 2, I mistakenly merged the fix-inverted-maskwith the master branch and deleted the fix-inverted-mask. So in order to do the third question, I will be redoing the whole thing again.
